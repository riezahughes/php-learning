Setting up you development environment:

Download and install Xampp: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
Make sure to install it OUTSIDE of program files in order to avoid silly situations regarding permissions happening.

Once it's been installed, right click it down on the taskbar and start up apache and mysql.

git clone this repository into xampp/htdocs/. You can access all files in your browser using http://localhost/myfoldername/myfile.txt

Create a project in xampp to make things easier, and set it to the cloned folder in the xampp htdocs directory.
