# php-learning
A repository of simple php lessons in github that will be used to teach a colleague about both git and some of the basic php stuff. If anyone feels like contributing lessons, please feel free.

# Before you Begin:
Php is a server-side scripting language. Where HTML, javascript and CSS make things look pretty on the front, PHP does all the hard work in the background. By utilising databases with it, PHP can be whatever you want it to be. literally. It can be used to procedurally generate markup, or to do form verifications. There's no limit to what itcan do. I'm terrible at writing, so all i can say is that using this language alongside your frontend knowledge, you can solve any problems you might have with building applications.

# Where do i start?
First, look into `000 - Setup` and work through whichever file applies to you. It's important that you install a localhost server and php correctly, otherwise you won't be able to see the results of your files.

For the sake of simplicity, we'll be using the *ATOM* text editor. This will integrate quite nicely with github and allow branches and commits without too much hassle.

# Things to remember:
If you're unsure what to do or how to do it, use your ```GOOGLE-FU```. Stackoverflow and the php manual are always great results in regards to what you're looking for.

It's okay to take a little time to understand things.

This is a terrible guide written by me, so if you get stuck please just ask!
